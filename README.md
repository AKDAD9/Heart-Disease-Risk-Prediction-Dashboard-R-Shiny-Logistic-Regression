# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Dashboard-R-Shiny-Logistic-Regression


# Project Overview
This project develops an interactive heart disease risk prediction system using logistic regression and R Shiny. The model estimates the probability of heart disease based on patient clinical data and categorizes patients into five medically interpretable risk levels.
The application is designed as a clinical decision support tool, transforming statistical predictions into actionable medical insights.
